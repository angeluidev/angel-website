                    <h5>Background</h5>
                    <p>The Glaze Pottery app design is a concept project for an imagined pottery studio and community. Glaze Pottery aims to bring together like-minded people who sees arts and crafts as a form of relaxation, even meditation. Users can see and register for the community events and pottery classes via the app. They can also shop for ceramics and handmade decor.</p>

            <h5>The Inspiration</h5>
            <p>It has been over a year since most countries have closed their borders and implemented lockdowns due to the raging pandemic. In light of this, various research have showed that people often reported feeling emotional distress, anxiety and depression with the continued isolation and minimal social connection.</p>
            <p>While leisure travel is still not allowed in and out of Singapore, the country has controlled the community cases to a minimum which paved the way to easing the lockdown measures. Now, people are looking for things to do to relax, unwind and gain a sense of some normalcy while being stuck in the small city-state.</p>

    <!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
        <hr>
        <div class="container-projects">
            <div class="projects-line">
                <h5>Understanding the problem</h5>
                <p>Due to COVID-19, there’s been an increased need for features such as online booking and contactless transactions and payments. Most pottery studios in Singapore do not offer these features. For those who do, either the user interface is not friendly (ex. checking the class schedule and dates on a dropdown list) or it’s not easily visible (ex. class schedule is under a ‘Services’ or ‘Shop’ tab).</p>

            <div class="projects-line">
                <h5>Product Vision and Solution</h5>
                <p>Create an E-commerce app for a pottery studio which makes class booking and ceramic shopping accessible and easy for users. To further understand the space, I conducted some market research on competitors and understand the current offerings. </p>
                <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
                <p>There are several pottery studios in Singapore. Most don’t have online booking systems. For those that have this feature, the user journey is not very intuitive. Here’s a closer look at some of the studios that appeared in the top search results.</p>

            <h5>Font</h5>
            <p>I experimented with 2 font pairings. I used Optima to give the headlines and title an elegant look. I used Avenir for most of the text and body copy for legibility.</p>

            <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
            <p>I also conducted a small test on the specific user journey of creating an account and booking a class. The testers noted that the signs to go through these user journeys were clear. There’s a 100% completion of the sign-up without any roadblocks or confusion.</p>
            <p>However, some users had missed a feature in the class booking step. Most did not notice that clicking the class card will lead them to giving more information about the type of class they’re booking. They clicked straight away on the ‘Book’ button.</p>

                    <p>Upon conducting the usability test, I’ve identified a gap in understanding on the class booking journey. All of the users mentioned that reading through the details of the different classes are important for them.</p>
                    <p>With the current design, it was not immediately visible. Therefore, it can be included as a primary change for the next iteration:</p>

                <div class="projects-flex next-steps-right">
                    <p>- Make the information about the different class types more visible and create multiple entry points, for example:</p>
                    <p><span>&#8226;</span> Add a section in the Home Page to show the info about the different classes.</p>
                    <p><span>&#8226;</span> Create an additional button on the class card in the Book page to indicate that the user can read the details.</p>
