                <h5>Background</h5>
                <p>Rentlah is a concept project for a 4-week UI Design short course that Designlab offers. It’s the re-imagined user experience of finding a rental home in Singapore. Borne by a first-hand, recent and frustrating house hunting experience - I designed a platform that will directly connect renters to property owners. It cuts the middlemen, therefore eliminating hefty agent fees and commissions on both sides.

<!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
    <hr>
    <div class="container-projects">
        <div class="projects-line">
            <h5>Understanding the problem</h5>
            <p>I drew from my personal experience of recently finding a rental home in Singapore. I also interviewed a handful of friends who have moved house to further understand the pain points. Based on these conversations and self-reflections, I found out:</p>
            <p>- Renters would like to save the extra money they spend in paying the real estate agent who found the rental home for them. The commission usually amounts to 1 to 2 months’ rent.</p>
            <p>- Renters are often bombarded with personal questions from agents as part of the verification and background check process, but the renters don’t have any idea about their landlord’s background.

<!-- PRODUCT VISION AND SOLUTION -->
    <hr>
    <div class="container-projects">
        <div class="projects-line">
            <h5>Product Vision and Solution</h5>
            <p>Inspired by the platform model of matching demand and supply, similar to Grab and Airbnb, the product’s vision is to connect eligible renters to verified property owners. The platform is specifically designed for rental homes, targeting to solve a specific set of needs and challenges.</p>
            <p>As a next step, I conducted some market research on competitors to investigate the current offerings and ideate based on features they lack that my target audience will appreciate.</p>
            <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
            <p>There are 3 main players in the property tech (proptech) scene in Singapore. Two of which are online property listings and the other is a co-living housing option</p>
